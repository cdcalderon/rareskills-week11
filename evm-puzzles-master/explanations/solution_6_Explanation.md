```

- Target => Index 0a (10) where 'JUMPDEST' is located

Here is what each of these instructions does:

- `PUSH1 00`: Pushes the value 0 onto the stack.
- `CALLDATALOAD`: Loads the data sent with the transaction from the position specified by the top item in the stack.
- `JUMP`: Jumps to the position in the code specified by the top item in the stack.
- `REVERT`: Stops execution and reverts all changes.
- `JUMPDEST`: A marker for valid jump destinations.
- `STOP`: Halts execution.

The puzzle revolves around the `CALLDATALOAD` operation which loads the data sent with the transaction from the position specified by the top item in the stack. This is 0 due to `PUSH1 00`. Hence, the first byte of the call data is loaded onto the stack.

The `JUMP` operation then jumps to the position in the code specified by the top item in the stack, which is the first byte of the call data. If this byte isn't 0x0A, the jump leads to a position with a `REVERT` operation, causing the transaction to revert.

To solve this puzzle, you need to send a transaction with call data where the first byte is 0x0A. This makes the `JUMP` operation jump to the `JUMPDEST` operation at position 0x0A, and then the `STOP` operation is executed, halting execution successfully without reverting.

Therefore, you should send a transaction with the data field set to "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a". As long as the last byte is 0x0A, the contract execution will be successful.
