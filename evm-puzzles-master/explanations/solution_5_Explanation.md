- Target => Index 0c (12) where 'JUMPDEST' is located

Here is what each of these instructions does:

- `CALLVALUE`: Pushes the value of the call (amount of Ether sent in wei) onto the stack.
- `DUP1`: Duplicates the top stack item.
- `MUL`: Multiplies the top two stack items and pushes the result onto the stack.
- `PUSH2 0100`: Pushes the value 256 onto the stack.
- `EQ`: Compares the top two stack items for equality and pushes 1 if they are equal, or 0 if they are not.
- `PUSH1 0C`: Pushes the value 12 onto the stack.
- `JUMPI`: If the top stack item is not 0, jumps to the instruction at the position equal to the second stack item. If the top stack item is 0, does nothing.
- `REVERT`: Stops execution and reverts all changes.
- `JUMPDEST`: A marker for valid jump destinations.
- `STOP`: Halts execution.

To solve this puzzle, you need to send a transaction where the `CALLVALUE` results in a square root of 256 when multiplied by itself, because `MUL` operation multiplies the top stack item by itself and `EQ` operation checks if the result is equal to 256.

Therefore, you need to send a transaction with a value of 16 wei. This will ensure that the multiplication result equals 256, satisfying the `EQ` operation and making the `JUMPI` operation jump to the `JUMPDEST` instruction, leading to successful execution of the contract.
