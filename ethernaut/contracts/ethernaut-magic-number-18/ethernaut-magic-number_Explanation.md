# Challenge objective

The challenge contract will validate our solution by calling the `whatIsTheMeaningOfLife()` function and checking if the response is 42. It will also check the size of our contract's bytecode to ensure it's no more than `10` opcodes.

# Solution Walkthrough

The solution to this challenge involves writing a contract in Assembly. We'll need to use the `PUSH`, `MSTORE`, and `RETURN` opcodes to store and return the number `42`.

```solidity
contract MagicNumSolver {
  constructor() public {
    assembly {
      mstore(0, 0x602a60005260206000f3)
      return(0x16, 0x0a)
    }
  }
}
```

## Explanation of the Assembly Code

Let's break down the Assembly code:

- `mstore(0, 0x602a60005260206000f3)`: This line stores our runtime logic at memory address 0. The runtime logic is represented as a hexadecimal string. The string is a series of opcodes that push the number 42 onto the stack, store it in memory, and prepare to return it.

- `return(0x16, 0x0a)`: This line returns the 10 bytes of runtime logic. The `0x16` is the offset that skips the leading zeros of the 32-byte word, and `0x0a` is the size of the runtime logic in bytes.

## Deploying the Solution

After writing the contract, we deploy it using a development environment like Remix or Hardhat. Once deployed, we copy the contract's address and call the `setSolver()` function on the Ethernaut contract, passing in our contract's address. If everything is done correctly, the challenge will be solved.

This challenge is a great exercise in understanding Ethereum's low-level language and how contracts are executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It shows that while Solidity makes it easy to write contracts, Assembly gives us more control and flexibility.
